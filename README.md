# vinci DAO Project

This project was initiated by students in ESILV, Paris La DÃ©fense as a way to handle vote between students and store immutable data on the blockchain as a proof of the fact we studied here for example.

This repo contains the contracts that rule our DAO and you can find the [white paper](./VinciDAO-white-paper.md) too.
